# Solving-Maze-Problems
# Overview
We aim to efficiently navigate through mazes, unraveling their intricate pathways and finding optimal solutions using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Through this exploration, we seek to deepen our understanding of algorithmic problem-solving and its practical applications in maze traversal and beyond.
